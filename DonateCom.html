<!--  Human-Interest Story  -->
<h3><span style="text-decoration: underline;"> Meet Norma</span></h3>
She moved from a mobile home into her first home, a property ecoREHAB rehabilitated for this retired school teacher.

Meet Norma. She moved from a mobile home into her “dream house,” an inviting, efficient home ecoREHAB transformed from an abandoned lot.
